# I want to use.  

# My primary bash profile.  Wherever possible I keep all content
# in there.

# Since I am a consultant I have one for each
# environment.  Since this bashrc file is shared publicly, all I
# will have here is a numerical listing of assignments, and none of
# the referenced files can be found outside of the assignment,
# nor is any name given.
